/* Hello!
This one is a simple one.
By now you must have created the portfolio page along with the ‘contact-me’ page. 
You must also have added styles to it. Please create an external css file and 
move the styles to it . Link the file to html page(s).

Please create an ‘ex3’ folder in git-repo that you used for ex1 and upload the page. 
Share the link, here. Save this and Submit.

(OR)

create a new folder (FSD) in http://spaces.w3schools.com , create an ‘ex3’ folder in it, 
upload both html pages to that location , publish/save and share the link here. 
Save this and Submit.

Feel free to click on the hint button on the top right of this page , to see sample page(s).
